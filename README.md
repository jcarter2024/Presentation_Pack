# Presentation_Pack
A virtual presentation environment that is both a presentation and a game!

This is an old-school style platformer designed for object interaction. The player interacts with the various items available, to "discover" aspects of the presentation.
For an overview of the game, startup, and information on the riming simulation open the Game_Guide.pdf

NOTE: Please play locally for now, compilation into single cross-platform executeable via ARCHER2 encountered a bug. Working on a fix. 

To run you will need python3 and pygame. 

Step 1: install pygame with pip like so:
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user

Step 2: Clone this directory to your machine, using git clone

Step 3: Change into the scripts/ directory and run the main script with python:
python3 main.py

A window should open, with the game playing. Enjoy!!
